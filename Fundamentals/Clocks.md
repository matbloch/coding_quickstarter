# Clocks





- **Atomic Clock**: An atomic clock is a highly accurate timekeeping device that uses the vibrations of atoms to measure time. Atoms such as cesium or rubidium are used as the reference because they oscillate at very specific frequencies. Atomic clocks are considered the most accurate timekeeping devices available and are used as a standard for timekeeping worldwide.

- **Steady Clock:** A steady clock, also known as a system clock, is a clock that is built into the processor of a mobile phone or other electronic devices. It is used to keep track of time within the device itself and is often based on a crystal oscillator, which produces a stable frequency that can be used to measure time.





**Clock drift**

Clock drift refers to the discrepancy between the time kept by a clock and the actual time. Even atomic and steady clocks are not perfect and can experience small variations in their timekeeping due to various factors such as temperature changes, electromagnetic interference, and manufacturing tolerances. Over time, these small variations can accumulate and result in clock drift, causing the clock to deviate from the accurate time.
