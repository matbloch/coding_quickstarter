# AWS Networking Basics



#### Networking Components

- **VPC:** Virtual Private Coud, dedicated to your AWS account
  - On creation: Specify range of IPv4 addresses using a "Classless Inter-Domain Routing" (CIDR) block, e.g. `10.0.0.0/16`
  - Spans all availability zones in the region
- **Subnets:** Allow service separation and higher security
  - On creation: Specify IP range using a CIDR block that is a subset of the VPC CIDR block.
  - Subnets cannot span multiple availability zones
  - launch instances in separate availability zone to protect from failure of a single location
  - public/private subnets: Subnet is **public** if traffic is routed to an **Internet gateway**
- **Route Tables:**
- **Internet Gateway:** Allows communication between 
- **NAT Gateway:**
- **AWS Private Link:** Allows connections to AWS services (e.g. for fetching docker images from ECR). Alternative to linking the private subnet to a NAT Gateway.



## VPCs and Subnets

TBD





### Examples

**Creating a private subnet**

1. Open the [AWS VPC Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/)
2. In the left navigation pane, choose **Subnets**.                         
3. Choose **Create Subnet**.
4. For **Name tag**, enter a name for your subnet, such as  **Private subnet**.                         
5. For **VPC**, choose the VPC that you created earlier.                         
6. For **Availability Zone**, choose a different Availability Zone than your original subnets in the VPC.                         
7. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter a valid CIDR block. For  example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use **10.0.3.0/24** for your second private                            subnet.
8. Choose **Yes, Create**.

---------

**Creating a public subnet**

1. In the left navigation pane, choose **Subnets** and then  **Create Subnet**.                         
2. For **Name tag**, enter a name for your subnet, such as **Public subnet**.                         
3. For **VPC**, choose the VPC that you created earlier.                         
4. For **Availability Zone**, choose the same Availability Zone as the additional private subnet that you created in the previous procedure.                         
5. For **IPv4 CIDR block**, enter a valid CIDR block. For example, the wizard creates CIDR blocks in 10.0.0.0/24 and 10.0.1.0/24 by default. You could use **10.0.2.0/24** for your second public                            subnet.
6. Choose **Yes, Create**.                         
7. Select the public subnet that you just created and choose **Route Table**, **Edit**.                         
8. By default, the private route table is selected. Choose the other available route table so that the **0.0.0.0/0** destination is routed to the internet gateway (**igw-xxxxxxxx**) and choose **Save**.                         
9. With your second public subnet still selected, choose **Subnet Actions**, **Modify auto-assign IP                               settings**.
10. Select **Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address** and choose **Save**, **Close**.                         

---------

**Deriving VPC of your cluster**

- Navigate to the ["CloudFormation" console](https://us-east-2.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation)
- Select your cluster
- Select "Resources"
- The VPC allocated with this cluster is denoted under the "VPC" id









## Route Tables

#### Routes and Route Tables

- Route tables gather together a set of routes. A route describes where do packets need to go based on rules. You can for instance send any packets with destination address starting with 10.0.4.x to a NAT while others with destination address 10.0.5.x to another NAT or internet gateway. You can describe both in and outbound routes.

- The way we associate a route table with a subnet is by using *Subnet Route Table Association* resources.



- What does 0.0 0.0 0 mean in a routing table?

  **0.0.0.0/0** represents all possible IP addresses. In the context of the way **routing tables** get set up by default on AWS, **0.0.0.0/0 is** effectively "all non local addresses". This **is** because another **route** presumably exists in the **routing table** to **route** the VPC subnet to the local network on the VPC.

**VPC Routing**

- When you associate a CIDR block with your VPC, a route (the main route table) is automatically added to your VPC route tables to enable routing within the VPC (the destination is the CIDR block and the target is `local`)
- Main route table allows communication inside the VPC

![vpc-main-route-table](img/vpc-main-route-table.PNG)

**Subnet Routing**

- Each subnet must be associated with a route table, which specifies the allowed routes for outbound traffic leaving the subnet



## Internet Gateway

Allows communication between the containers  and the internet. All the outbound traffic goes through it. In AWS it must get attached to a VPC.

All requests from a instances running  on the public subnet must be routed to the internet gateway. This is  done by defining routes laid down on route tables.





## Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway

You can use a network address translation (NAT) instance in a **public** subnet in your VPC to enable instances in the **private** subnet to initiate outbound IPv4 traffic to the Internet or other AWS services (e.g. to pull Docker images), but prevent the instances from receiving inbound traffic initiated by someone on the Internet.

**NAT Gateway vs. NAT Instance**

- NAT Gateway: Managed by AWS, less configuration options
- NAT Instance: Managed by you, more configuration options (such as port forwarding) at the cost of higher maintenance
- See also [Instance vs Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-comparison.html)

#### Example: Creating a NAT Gateway

1. Head to the AWS VPC Console
2. "NAT Gateways > Create NAT Gateway"
3. Select public Subnet
4. Assign or create a new Elastic IP



## Network Security / Security Groups

- Security groups act as firewalls between inbound and outbound communications of the instances we run

- Security group rules are implicit deny, which means all traffic is denied unless an inbound or outbound rule explicitly allows it.




### Examples

**Chaining security groups**

- Inbound traffic can be limited to sources that have a specific security group assigned
- In this examples:
  - **The ALB** receives traffic from all IPs on port 80 and forwards it to Service 1
  - **Service 1** only allows traffic from the security group A and forwards it to Service 2
  - **Service 2** only allows traffic from security group B

![chaining-security-groups](img/chaining-security-groups.PNG)

**Limiting traffic to a subnet**

- Inbound traffic can be limited to a subnet by specifying the subnet's IP/CIDR as source

![restricting-traffic-to-subnet](img/restricting-traffic-to-subnet.PNG)



### Sample Configurations

**Allow connections between instances within the same security group**

| Protocol type | Protocol number | Ports    | Source IP                    |
| ------------- | --------------- | -------- | ---------------------------- |
| -1 (All)      | -1 (All)        | -1 (All) | The ID of the security group |

**Allow HTTP requests from within the VPC**

| Protocol type | Source      | Ports |
| ------------- | ----------- | ----- |
| tcp           | 10.0.0.0/16 | 80    |

**Allow connections from within a Subnet**

| Protocol type | Source   | Ports |
| ------------- | -------- | ----- |
| tcp           | 10.0.1.0 | 80    |





## AWS PrivateLink

- before PrivateLink, EC2 instances had to use an internet gateway to download docker images stored in ECR or to communicate with the ECS control plane. Instances in public subnet used the internet gateway directly. Instances in private subnet used a network address translation (NAT) gateway hosted in a public subnet.
- Now that AWS PrivateLink support has been added, instances in both  public and private subnets can use it to get private connectivity to  download images from Amazon ECR. Instances can also communicate with the ECS control plane via AWS PrivateLink endpoints without needing an  internet gateway or NAT gateway.

## Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)

The Load Balancer should be your gateway to the cluster. When running a  web service, make sure you've running your cluster in a private subnet  and your containers cannot be accessed directly from the internet.  Ideally, your internal container should expose a random, ephemeral port  which is bound to a target group. Make sure also that traffic is only  allowed from the Load Balancer's Security Group.



**ELB (Elastic Load Balancer)**

- can be in public or private subnets
- can be in multiple subnets (e.g. across availability zones)
- **public**: connect service to internet
- **private**: routing e.g. between web and app tier (note that you get charged for an ELB)



The Application Load Balancer (ALB) is the  single point of contact for clients (users). Its function is to relay  the request to the right running task (think of a task as an instance  for now).

> In our case all requests on port 80 are forwarded to nginx task.

To configure a load balancer we need to specify a *listener* and a *target group*. The listener is described through rules, where you can specify  different targets to route to based on port or URL. The target group is  the set of resources that would receive the routed requests from the  ALB.

This target group will be managed by Fargate and every time a new instance of nginx spins up then it will register it automatically  on this group, so we donâ€™t have to worry about adding instances to the  target group at all.



### External Traffic Routing

[TODO:  image]



### Internal Routing

- e.g. as alternative to service discovery



[TODO: Image]



#### Example: Creating a Load Balancer

- Navigate to "Load Balancers" and create a new one

- Select scheme "internet-facing" (will expose your application to the internet)

- Select the VPC of your cluster

- Select subnets from your availability zone

- Select a security group

  - select default ECS security group (all sources to port 80)
  - or create a new one

- Select the created target group (the service you want to expose to the internet)

  - Note: You have to assign your ECS instances to this target group so that they receive the traffic

- Verify that your service is accessible:

  - Select "Load Balancers" from the "Load Balacing" Tab

  - Open the DNS name (A Record) in the "Description" Tab of your load balancer, e.g.:

    `celery-flask-8413341.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com`









## Example: VPC with a Single Public Subnet

## Example: VPC with Public and Private Subnets (NAT)

https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html



**Subnet Setup Best practice**

- use public subnets for external resources and private subnets for internal resources
- different routing tables for private and public subnets
- public subnets share a single routing table; the only route they use is to the Internet-gateway to communicate with the Internet



https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_Scenario2.html

**Routing**

Main Route Table

| Destination   | Target             | Purpose                                                      |
| ------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local              | Default entry for local routing. Enables instances in the VPC to communicate with each other. |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | <*nat-gateway-id*> | Sends all other subnet traffic to the NAT gateway.           |

Custom Route Table

| Destination   | Target   | Purpose |
| ------------- | -------- | ------------- |
| `10.0.0.0/16` | local| Default entry for local routing. |
| `0.0.0.0/0`   | <*igw-id*> | Routes all other subnet traffic to the Internet over the Internet gateway. |
