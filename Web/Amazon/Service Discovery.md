# Service Discovery



**Requirements**

- all services must be in the same subnet





#### Service Discovery

In our application, we want the backend to be reachable at *ecsfs-backend.local*, the frontend at *ecsfs-frontend.local*, etcâ€¦ You can see the names are suffixed with *.local.* In AWS we can create a ***PrivateDnsService\*** resource and add services to them, and that would produce the aforementioned names, that is, `.`.

By creating various DNS names under the same namespace, services that get  assigned those names can talk between them, i.e. the frontend talking to a backend, or nginx to the frontend.

The *IP* addresses  for each service task are dynamic, they change, and sometimes more than  task might be running for the same serviceâ€¦ soâ€¦ how do we associate the  DNS name with the right task? ðŸ¤” Well we donâ€™t! Fargate does it all for  us.



### Setup

- enable service discovery during creation of the ECS services
- during task creation:
  - use bridge/host network mode for `SRV` records
  - use awsvpc network mode for `A` record



To allow your tasks to communicate with each other, complete the following steps:

1. [Create a new service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/create-service-discovery.html) using service discovery.
2. [Confirm that tasks are running](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/ecs_run_task.html) in the Amazon ECS service.
3. [Associate a private hosted zone](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zone-private-associate-vpcs.html) with the correct Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC).
4. [Enable DNS resolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/VPC_DHCP_Options.html#AmazonDNS) for the Amazon VPC with AmazonProvidedDNS.





### Nginx and ECS Service discovery

- use variable to force Nginx to resolve address at runtime
- otherwise Nginx would not route to new containers

```
set $backend "api.local";
proxy_pass http://$backend:5000;
```

- nginx container network mode to "host" (?)

## Architecture Patterns

#### Public Service, Public Network

- A public facing endpoint designed to receive push notifications
- An edge service which needs to make outbound connections to other services on the internet

#### Public Service, Private Network

- A service which is public facing but needs an extra layer of security  hardening by not even having a public IP address that an attacker could  send a request directly to.
- A service which initiates outbound connections but to the public you  want those connections to **originate from a specific and limited set of  IP addresses** that can be whitelisted

#### Private DNS Service Discovery

**Use Cases**

- Private, internal service discovery
- Low latency communication between services
- Long lived bidirectional connections, such as gRPC.

**Configuration**

- Single private Subnet
- Containers inside the subnet can communicate to each other using their  internal IP addresses. But they need some way to discover each otherâ€™s  IP address.

**Service Discovery**

- Option 1: DNS
- Option 2: REST api
