## Architecture Patterns

#### Public Service, Public Network

- A public facing endpoint designed to receive push notifications
- An edge service which needs to make outbound connections to other services on the internet

#### Public Service, Private Network

- A service which is public facing but needs an extra layer of security  hardening by not even having a public IP address that an attacker could  send a request directly to.
- A service which initiates outbound connections but to the public you  want those connections to **originate from a specific and limited set of  IP addresses** that can be whitelisted

#### Private DNS Service Discovery

**Use Cases**

- Private, internal service discovery
- Low latency communication between services
- Long lived bidirectional connections, such as gRPC.

**Configuration**

- Single private Subnet
- Containers inside the subnet can communicate to each other using their  internal IP addresses. But they need some way to discover each otherâ€™s  IP address.

**Service Discovery**

- Option 1: DNS
- Option 2: REST api
