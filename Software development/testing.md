## Testing Patterns



### Transactions

- Fundamental concept of all database systems
- Bundles multiple steps into a single, all-or-nothing operation

**Properties**

- **Atomic:** succeeded, or failed

- **Isolation:** ensures that transactions operated independently of of others; they are not visible till completed

  

### Fixtures

**Test Flow**

1. Begin transaction
2. Factories
3. Execute Logic
4. Assertions
5. Rollback transaction



### Mocking

TBD
