# C++ 11 Features

- [New C++ language features](https://github.com/AnthonyCalandra/modern-cpp-features#return-type-deduction)

- braced initialisation: https://blog.quasardb.net/2017/03/05/cpp-braced-initialization



### Misc Features



#### `constexpr`

**constexpr vs inline functions:**

- **inline**: expanded at compile time, save time of function call overhead (allways evaluated at run time)
- **Constexpr**: evaluated at compile time

constexpr specifies that the value of an object or a function can be  evaluated at compile time and the expression can be used in other  constant expressions.  For example, in below code product() is evaluated at compile time.

1. In C++ 11, a constexpr function should contain only one return statement. C++ 14 allows more than one statements.

2. constexpr function should refer only constant global variables.

3. constexpr function can call only other constexpr function not simple function.

4. Function should not be of void type and some operator like prefix increment (++v) are not allowed in constexpr function.
